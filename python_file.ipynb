       "\"In Maltese Law, the general theory of criminal intent is constructed based on the building blocks of will and understanding. Will refers to the conscious and voluntary decision to commit a criminal act, while understanding refers to the knowledge and awareness of the consequences of that act.\\n\\nWill is an essential element in criminal intent as it demonstrates the deliberate choice to engage in the prohibited conduct. It requires a conscious and free decision to commit the act, showing that the individual had control over their actions and intentionally chose to engage in the criminal behavior.\\n\\nUnderstanding, on the other hand, involves the knowledge and awareness of the consequences of the act. It requires the individual to have a clear understanding of the nature and potential harm caused by their actions. This element ensures that the person committing the act is aware of the potential consequences and is therefore responsible for their actions.\\n\\nMotive, premeditation, and good faith are relevant factors in determining criminal intent in Maltese Law. Motive refers to the reason or purpose behind the criminal act. While motive alone is not sufficient to establish criminal intent, it can provide insight into the individual's state of mind and their reasons for committing the act.\\n\\nPremeditation refers to the deliberate planning or consideration of the criminal act before its execution. It demonstrates a higher level of intent and can be used as evidence to establish the accused's state of mind and their intention to commit the crime.\\n\\nGood faith, on the other hand, refers to the honest belief that one's actions are lawful or justified. It can be a defense in certain circumstances where the accused genuinely believed that their actions were legal or necessary to protect themselves or others. However, good faith alone is not enough to negate criminal intent if the accused's actions still meet the elements of the offense.\\n\\nIn summary, will and understanding are the fundamental elements of criminal intent in Maltese Law. They require a conscious and voluntary decision to commit the act and an awareness of the consequences. Motive, premeditation, and good faith are relevant factors that can provide further insight into the accused's state of mind and their intentions, but they are not determinative of criminal intent on their own.\""

       "\"Under Maltese law, self-defense may be successfully pleaded as a defense against a criminal charge if certain conditions are met. The relevant articles to consider are Article 223 and Article 224 of the Maltese Criminal Code.\\n\\nArticle 223 states that not all those who act to defend themselves can invoke self-defense. In order to plead self-defense, the aggression suffered must be unjust, grave, and inevitable. This means that the person claiming self-defense must have been subjected to an unjust and serious attack that could not have been avoided or averted in any other way. If the person instead confronts the aggressor without a valid reason and participates in a physical confrontation that could have been reasonably avoided, the element of inevitability is lacking, and self-defense cannot be successfully pleaded.\\n\\nFurthermore, the act of self-defense must be proportional. This means that the person acting in self-defense cannot use more force than necessary to repel the attack. For example, if the aggressor is not using firearms, the person acting in self-defense cannot use firearms either. The use of force must be reasonable and necessary to protect oneself or others from harm.\\n\\nIn addition to these requirements, Article 224 provides specific circumstances in which self-defense may be successfully pleaded. These circumstances include:\\n\\n1. The act of self-defense is committed in the act of repelling the scaling or breaking of enclosures, walls, or entrance doors of a house or inhabited apartment during the nighttime.\\n2. The act of self-defense is committed in the act of defending against a person committing theft or plunder with violence or attempting to commit such theft or plunder.\\n3. The act of self-defense is imposed by the actual necessity of defending one's own chastity or the chastity of another person.\\n\\nIt is important to note that self-defense must be based on the subjective perception of the person claiming self-defense at the time of the confrontation. The court must place itself in the shoes of the accused and consider their mental and physical state at the time of the incident. The danger must be sudden, actual, and absolute, and the accused must have believed that there was no other means of escaping the danger.\\n\\nHowever, it is also important to highlight that self-defense does not include retaliation. Self-defense is a response to an ongoing threat, whereas retaliation is a response to a past harm. Retaliation cannot be considered justifiable legitimate self-defense under Article 223.\\n\\nIn summary, self-defense may be successfully pleaded as a defense against a criminal charge under Maltese law if the aggression suffered is unjust, grave, and inevitable, and if the act of self-defense is proportional and based on the subjective perception of the accused at the time of the incident. The specific circumstances outlined in Article 224 further clarify when self-defense may be successfully pleaded.\""
